/*
-> initilization: Typically variable will be initilizes and statement will be executed onces before the loop start
-> condition: This expression is evaluate before the each iteration start if the code is true loop is continue and if it is false loop will stop
-> increment/decrement: This is usallay incerment and decrement the variable when the statement is executed after the each iteration
